# Cere Bug Bounty
Cere invites bug hunters, security experts and ethical hackers to identify and report potential bugs and security vulnerabilities in the Cere Network ecosystem. We believe that by taking a proactive approach we improve the network‚Äôs security, ensuring a safer environment for all current and future users and their data. 

## Background
Cere is a decentralized blockchain and p2p cloud storage protocol built for handling all classes of cross-chain storage workloads, enabling projects to keep their data safe, in a decentralized, permissionless and interoperable environment based on Substrate and our own decentralized data protocol the Decentralized Data Cloud or DDC. 

With Cere Network and the DDC being such a complex system, plus the fact there are real-value digital assets at stake, it‚Äôs critical that additional resources are allocated to ensuring the core code commits in the ecosystem should get as many reviews as possible, to minimize risk of exposure to bugs and other issues that might result in system malfunction and loss of funds or data.

## How to Start
- Step 1: Sign-up via [this form](https://noteforms.com/forms/contributor-sign-up) to register as a Contributor.
- Step 2: Report any potential issues discovered.
  ‚ö†Ô∏è¬†**DO NOT CREATE ANY PUBLIC ISSUE OR POSTS related to (potential) security related findings**. See the [Responsible Disclosure](https://www.notion.so/Cere-Bug-Bounty-d6d2b20f473d43d39c93294335e29015?pvs=21) section below for more details.

That‚Äôs it! A member of the the Cere Community team will reach out about your experience completing this mission and clarify any final questions regarding your registration and share additional details about getting started onboarding to Cere Network.

## Bounty Payouts
Cere Bounty payouts for issues reported are as follows:
üí°¬†Legend - Severity Levels & Payouts
- Critical   |  $5,000 - $10,000+
- High       |  $1,000 - $5,000
- Medium     |  $500 - $1,000
- Low & Info |  $50 - $500
üîè All reports will be assessed by independent security auditors for final severity rating.

## Payment
- The CERE/USD conversion rate used for payments is the average market price for the month in which the bug was submitted.
- The reference for this price is calculated based on the Closing Price given by Coingecko.com given [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cere-network).
- The final severity and payout recommendation of all valid issues reported are decided by the Cere Bug Bounty Team, with consultation with Halborn security team and other third-party security consultants, if necessary. We will make this as transparent of a process as possible to ensure all parties are satisfied and agree with the outcome.

## In Scope
These vulnerabilities often require a deep understanding of both traditional web security and the unique aspects of blockchain technology. Each of these topics has its own set of challenges and requires specialized knowledge to tackle effectively.
- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: This is often the most critical area in Web3 bug bounties. Issues can range from reentrancy attacks, integer overflows, and unauthorized access to funds or data. Understanding the Solidity programming language and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is crucial for identifying these vulnerabilities.
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Exploits**: With the rise of DeFi platforms, vulnerabilities in lending protocols, yield farming contracts, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have become increasingly common. Bugs in these areas can lead to massive financial losses.
- **Front-End Security**: Even though the blockchain backend might be secure, vulnerabilities in the front-end can expose users to risks like phishing attacks, wallet manipulations, and data leaks. Ensuring the security of Web3-enabled browsers and extensions like MetaMask is essential.
- **Oracles and Data Feeds**: Oracles provide external data to smart contracts and are a common point of failure. Manipulating oracles can lead to incorrect data being fed into smart contracts, causing unintended behavior.> 
- **Governance and Voting Mechanisms**: Many Web3 platforms have governance tokens and voting systems to make collective decisions. Vulnerabilities in these systems can lead to unfair voting, token minting, or changes in critical platform parameters.
- **Front-End Vulnerabilities**: As mentioned earlier, issues like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) can be particularly damaging in a Web3 context, where users often interact with decentralized applications through web interfaces.
- **Phishing Attacks**: Given the irreversible nature of blockchain transactions, phishing attacks that trick users into revealing their private keys or sending funds to malicious addresses are a significant concern.
- **Sybil Attacks**: In decentralized networks, Sybil attacks involve creating multiple fake identities to subvert the functioning of the network. This can be particularly problematic in peer-to-peer networks and decentralized identity systems.
- **Node Vulnerabilities**: Full nodes, mining nodes, and other network participants can have vulnerabilities that allow attackers to crash the network or perform other malicious activities.
- **Replay Attacks**: In some cases, transactions on one blockchain can be replayed on another blockchain, leading to unintended financial consequences. This is often a concern during blockchain forks.
- **Eclipse Attacks**: In this type of attack, an attacker monopolizes all of the victim's incoming and outgoing connections, effectively isolating the victim from the rest of the network.
- **Routing Attacks**: Given that many blockchain networks operate over peer-to-peer protocols, they are susceptible to routing attacks like BGP hijacking, which can redirect network traffic through malicious nodes.
- **Data Exposure**: Improperly secured IPFS nodes or other decentralized storage solutions can expose sensitive user data.
- **Authorization Flaws**: Incorrect implementation of roles and permissions can lead to unauthorized actions, especially in multi-signature or governance contracts.
- **Timestamp Manipulation**: Some smart contracts rely on block timestamps for functionality. Manipulating these can lead to unintended contract behavior.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Overloading network nodes or smart contracts by exploiting gas costs can make the system unresponsive.

# Appendix
## Severity Legend
- **Critical**: Critical severity issues present a direct and immediate risk to a broad array of our users or to a Cere network product itself. 
**High**: High severity issues allow an attacker to read or modify highly sensitive data that they are not authorized to access. They are generally more narrow in scope than critical issues, though they may still grant an attacker extensive access.
- **Medium**: Medium severity issues allow an attacker to read or modify limited amounts of data that they are not authorized to access. They generally grant access to less sensitive information than high severity issues.
- **Low & Info**: Low & informational issues allow an attacker to access extremely limited amounts of data. They may violate an expectation for how something is intended to work but allow nearly no escalation of privilege or ability to trigger unintended behavior by an attacker.
