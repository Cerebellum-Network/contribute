# Cere Grants Program

## About

The Cere Grants Program targets technology-oriented projects of protocol layer and applications that serve a wide range of users. The program provides guidelines for various areas such as runtime modules/chains, development tools, UI development, backend development, cryptography, research, and documentation.

Cere is currently accepting Grant Proposals that cover all all areas of the Cere Stack, including innovations in Web2 Application integrations, bleeding edge, on-chain Dapps and Smart Contract systems, development and testing tools, optimizations, and other ideas that are important for the Cere Network and the Decentralized Data Cloud ecosystem.

We're thrilled that you're interested in applying for a grant with Cere. We are looking forward to your reviewing your application!

## Guidelines

To increase your chances of getting accepted, we recommend the following:

- Present a well-researched or tested concept, ideally with some prior work to showcase.
- Demonstrate that the project will be maintained after completion of the grant, whether through a commitment to the technology, additional funding sources, or an existing business model.
- Have a team with proven experience in relevant languages and technologies and/or a strong technical background. As part of your application, we ask you to provide the GitHub profiles of all team members so we can examine past activity and code quality. You can also link to projects on other platforms.
- Create an application that is rich in technical details and well-defined.
- Clearly present how your project stands out among competitors or implements technology that doesn't exist in the ecosystem yet.

## Requirements

- All code produced as part of a grant must be open-sourced, and it must not rely on closed-source software for full functionality. We prefer Apache 2.0, but MIT and GPLv3 are also acceptable.
- All forked or otherwise copied code must be properly attributed to indicate it wasn't your own work, originally.
- Your project can not have been the object of a token sale or other fund raising initiative.
- Your project can not have been accepted (as-such) into a Hackathon or such event (without prior approval).
- Your project must include documentation that explains how their project works. Tutorials or videos are also super helpful for new users to understand how to use your product.
- We do not fund projects that actively encourage gambling, illicit trade, money laundering, or criminal activities in general.
- Further restrictions and requirements can be found in our Cere Grants Terms & Conditions.

We also do have a code of conduct that we take pretty seriously. Based on this, we may need to¬†[block users](https://github.blog/2016-04-04-organizations-can-now-block-abusive-users/)¬†who don't comply with our rules. But we're sure you'll do great!

üíú¬†Good luck with your application! üíú

## Project Ideas

To get an overview of existing projects in the Cere Technology Stack and to find broad project ideas that we would potentially be interested in funding, please refer to the [Grant Tracks file](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/Cere-Grants-Program/blob/master/Documentation/cere-grant-tracks.md).

If you have a great idea but are unsure about the technical challenges involved, don't worry! You can always reach out to us at `community@cere.io` for feedback and advice before applying or pushing a PR against the Grant Tracks file. We're happy to consider new ideas!

## Support

Our Grants Programs provide funding and feedback on delivered milestones. While we do not guarantee hands-on support as part of a grant, we will do our best to help you face specific issues during development and direct you to the correct resources. If you need more hands-on support, you can also reach out to us at `community@cere.io` to discuss additional options available. We are happy to work out a plan to get you the hands-on technical, ecosystem, and strategic long-term support and access to extensive resources you need.

You can find general documentation and more information on Cere Network and the DDC on the [Cere‚Äôs Community Portal](https://portal.cere.network) and the [Contributor FAQ](https://portal.cere.network/FAQ-47632bf4e3ff45ab999e66463d634fbf), and we encourage you to join the [Cere Contributor‚Äôs Discord](https://www.notion.so/5fd4b7fa6ddf43309e167154477d59d2?pvs=21) to get help with specific issues or stay up to date with the most recent developments.

## Application Process

### Application Submission

1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/Cere-Grants-Program/tree/master) (branch: `master`)  or `git pull` to update your existing repo.
2. Create a new branch called `Grant App - Project Name`.
3. Create a copy of the `Application Template` file in the `Applications/` directory of your newly created fork.
4. Name the new file after your project: `project_name.md`.
5. Fill out the template with the details of your project.
üí°¬†That file should contain ALL necessary information for complete evaluation of the proposed grant! And the more information, the faster the review.
6. Review the `Terms and Conditions` file inside the Documents folder.
7. Once you're done, create a pull request.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è¬†By initiating a pull request, you are indicating you have ready and accepted the terms and conditions as provided.

8. At this stage, the pull request should only contain *one new file* ‚Äî the markdown file you created from the template.

### Application Review

1. The Cere Foundation Grants Committee will issue comments and request changes on the pull request.
2. Clarifications and amendments made in the comments need to be included in the application. You may address feedback by modifying your application directly and leaving a comment once you're done.
3. The application is accepted when all requested changes are addressed, and the terms and conditions have been agreed upon.
4. The application will be subject to automatic rejection after 2 weeks of inactivity.

    Unless specified otherwise, the day on which it is accepted will be considered the starting date of the project, and will be used to estimate delivery dates.


### Onboarding

Once your Grant Application (PR) is approved, we will initiate Project Onboarding, where you will:

1. be welcomed to the programme with an introduction to the team and an overview of the legal and funding aspects.
2. Meet your Project Mentor.
3. Plan check-in & Office-Hours schedule.
4. Officially Kick-off your project.

### Milestone Review, Delivery, and Payment

Milestones are to be delivered according to the following instructions:

1. Use the same GitHub account that submitted the application.
    1. Create a new branch based on the `Grant App` branch created previously named `Milestones - Project Name`.
    2. Duplicate the `Milestone Delivery Template` file in the `Milestones Delivery` folder.
    3. If this is your first milestone: Create a new folder in the `Milestones Delivery` folder you‚Äôre in now named `$Project Name`.
    4. Rename the new file to `milestone-X.md` and move it to the `$Project Name` folder you created previously.
    5. Follow the instructions as shown in the `milestone-X.md` file created previously.
    6. Commit the changes to the new previously created project milestones branch.
    7. Prepare a pull request against the original Grants Repository to initiate the review!
2. Finally, submit your invoice to `community@cere.io`.

    Payment is made in ERC-20 Cere Token or USDC on Ethereum or Polygon Mainnet.


Optionally, for Maintenance Grants:

1. At the end of each month, you will need to provide a comprehensive report of the work done, including the list of issues/bugs/pull requests worked on, time spent on each of these & finally the associated cost.

### Changes to a Grant after Approval

Accepted grant applications can be amended at any time. However, doing so necessitates a re-evaluation by the committee and requires the same number of approvals as a new application. If your application has been accepted and during development you find that your project significantly deviates from the original specifications, please open a new pull request that modifies the existing application. This also applies in case of significant delays.

- If there are significant changes to your delivery schedule, please open a pull request with an updated timeline.
- If your deliveries are delayed by more than 2 weeks without justification or further communication, the committee reserves the right to initiate the Grant Termination Process.

### Grant Termination

To initiate grant termination, a member of the Grant Committee (or the grant recipient themselves) can create a Termination pull request (PR) for review and response from the committee and corresponding grant recipients. The termination PR must

- REMOVE the originally accepted application file
- Include a summary of the reasons for termination, including potential steps for remediation.

The proposed termination PR will be open for review and comments for 2 weeks.

After this period, if the termination proposal receives 3 approvals, regardless of level, the termination PR will be accepted, and the grant will be terminated.

All funding and other services will be terminated immediately, with no exceptions. If the proposed project is to be reconsidered, a new application process will be required.
