# Unlock a Grant for $10,000 with Free DDC Cloud Storage!
Cere Network x Decentralized Data Storage Developer Bounty: Unlock up to $10,000 for Your Project with Free Cloud Storage! 

## Grant Objective
If you're a developer exploring options for a network where you can develop your application with secure, decentralized cloud storage, look no further! Cere Network is excited to unveil a specialized bounty program tailored just for you. By integrating your project with Cere's Decentralized Data Cloud (DDC), you could earn a substantial grant reward.

## Background
Cere’s DDC is pushing the boundaries of decentralized data storage and management. The project is approaching the launch the v2 protocol, promising a more mature and stable experience for developers, and the we are looking to attract developers to build applications that integrate with the DDC, fostering the growth of its ecosystem. The way we see it, mo’ applications, mo’ users. This in turn strengthens the network's utility and value. A win:win for everyone!
This bounty is meant to support early believers in our new protocol a chance to explore and utilize the full range of features offered by the DDC. As build build and integrators integrate, we hope the versatility and robustness of the DDC will shine through to a wider audience.
Additionally, in our experience, engaging with developers provides the most valuable feedback we can ask for. This feedback has been instrumental in refining and enhancing the DDC's features to this point, and we hope this bounty will push us even closer to meeting the evolving needs of its users.

## Deliverables
We’re not here to tell you what is or isn’t possible. You already know what the market needs, and what your project needs to get it there. We expect this bounty to stimulate your creativity, and hope it will lead to unexpected and innovative uses of the DDC. Really. We want YOU to tell us what’s missing in the ecosystem and how to build it.

By opening up the platform to a diverse group of developers, Cere intends to tap into the wealth of creativity and problem-solving skills in our community, leading to novel applications and solutions.

That said, there are still a few requirements your project proposal will be judged on for acceptance:

- **Genuine Use Case Required**: Your project must have a legitimate need for data storage. Applications that merely flood the network with random data will be disqualified.
- **Utilize DDC Storage Smart Contract**: You are required to call the DDC storage smart contract, whether using smart contracts, an existing DDC SDK, or any other novel approach you might bring to the table.

## Reward
Your project could receive up to $10,000 along with additional free cloud storage, simply by integrating with Cere DDC's decentralized storage solutions.
