# Add DDC Python SDK - Grants up to $10,000
Request for Grant Proposals: Porting Cere DDC JS SDK to Python 3.

## Grant Objective
Cere invites proposals from qualified external developers to port our existing Cere DDC JS SDK (reference implementation) to Python 3, the world's most popular programming language! This initiative aims to broaden the accessibility and usability of our SDK, thereby fostering greater innovation and inclusivity within the developer community.

## Background
Python has emerged as a leading programming language, known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It is widely used in various domains including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific research, and more. Given Python's extensive library support and active community, porting the Cere DDC JS SDK to Python 3 will significantly expand its reach and applicability.
The Cere DDC (Decentralized Data Cloud) is a groundbreaking technology that enables secure and efficient data sharing and storage solutions. The current SDK, written in JavaScript, has been instrumental in facilitating seamless interactions with the Cere DDC. However, we recognize the need to make our SDK more versatile to cater to a broader range of developers and use-cases. By porting it to Python 3, we aim to tap into Python's rich ecosystem and offer more developers the tools they need to integrate with Cere DDC effectively.

## Scope of Work
The goal is to develop a Python 3 SDK that allows developers to interact with the Decentralized Data Cloud (DDC) platform. The SDK should offer similar functionalities to the existing JavaScript SDK available in the Cerebellum Network's GitHub repository.

### Features Support
1. Initialization
    - Initialize the SDK with necessary configurations (e.g., API keys, network endpoints).
2. Authentication
    - Support for various authentication methods (e.g., OAuth, API tokens).
3. Data Management
    - CRUD operations for data objects.
    - Batch operations for handling multiple data objects.
4. Event Management
    - Event subscription and unsubscription.
    - Event querying based on various filters (e.g., date range, event type).
5. File Management
    - Upload and download files.
    - File metadata management.
6. User Management
    - CRUD operations for user profiles.
    - User authentication and authorization.
7. Error Handling
    - Comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms.
8. Documentation
    - Detailed API documentation.
    - Examples and tutorials.
9. Testing
    - Unit tests for all features.
    - Integration tests for critical paths.
10. Logging and Monitoring
    - Built-in logging features.
    - Support for external monitoring tools.
11. Extensibility
    - The SDK should be designed in a modular way to allow for future extensions.

### Deliverables
1. Source code for the Python 3 SDK in Github.
2. Comprehensive documentation.
3. Test framework with sufficient automated test coverage.
4. Sample applications demonstrating the SDK's capabilities.


## Reward
Your project could receive up to $10,000 along with additional free cloud storage.

## Evaluation Criteria
