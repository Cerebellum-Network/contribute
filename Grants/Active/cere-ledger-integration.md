# CERE Ledger Integration
Cere invites proposals from qualified external developers to deliver Ledger hardware support for Cere Network, a Substrate based nPoS blockchain.

## Grant Objective
The Cere Community has frequently expressed the need for hardware wallet compatibility. Ledger, known for its Ledger Nano S and Ledger Nano X, stands out as a leading hardware wallet provider. This bounty serves as an open call for community proposals to integrate Cere Blockchain with Ledger Wallet.

## Background
To support Substrate-based networks like Cere Network on Ledger devices, the following features are generally needed:
1. **Network-Specific Ledger App**: A dedicated app for the Substrate-based network needs to be developed for Ledger devices.
2. **Third-Party Wallet Integration**: Even if Ledger Live doesn't support the network, the Ledger device should be compatible with a third-party wallet that does.
3. **Transaction Signing**: Ledger devices should support the network's unique transaction formats for signing and verification.
4. **Asset Management**: The Ledger device must support the storage and management of native tokens and other assets on the network.
5. **Firmware Updates**: The device should be capable of firmware updates to incorporate future changes in the network's protocol.
6. **Secure Communication**: Proper encryption and secure communication channels must be in place between the Ledger device and the network.

The active development community around a specific Substrate-based network can expedite its Ledger support by focusing on these features.
