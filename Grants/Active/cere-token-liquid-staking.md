# Liquid Staking Derivitives for Staked Tokens on Cere Network - Grant up to $10,000+
Weâ€™re calling developers for sharing their solutions for Liquid Staking Derivatives for Staked Tokens on Cere Network. [Apply now!](https://noteforms.com/forms/cere-grants-application-el0u0b)

## Introduction
Cere Network, a Substrate-based blockchain network, is seeking proposals from qualified developers and organizations to design and implement a Liquid Staking Derivatives platform for staked tokens. The aim is to unlock liquidity for staked assets, allowing token holders to participate in staking while also having the flexibility to engage in other financial activities.

## Background
Staking is an essential part of the Cere Network, providing security and stability to the blockchain. However, staking locks up assets, making them illiquid and unavailable for other uses. Liquid staking derivatives can solve this problem by representing staked tokens as tradable assets, thereby providing liquidity and enabling additional financial activities.

## Objectives
1. To develop a secure and efficient Liquid Staking Derivatives platform on Cere Network.
2. To enable token holders to freely trade, lend, or use their staked tokens in DeFi protocols.
3. To maintain the integrity and security of the staking process on Cere Network.

## Reward
A Builder Grant up to $10,000 is available for this project.

## Scope of Work
### Features to be Supported
1. Issuance of Staking Derivatives: Mechanism for issuing derivatives that represent staked tokens.
2. Trading Platform: A decentralized exchange (DEX) for trading staking derivatives.
3. Integration with Existing Staking Mechanisms: Seamless integration with Cere Network's existing staking protocols.
4. User Interface: A user-friendly dashboard for managing staking and trading derivatives.
5. Smart Contracts: Secure and efficient smart contracts to handle the issuance and trading of derivatives.
6. APIs and SDKs: Develop APIs and SDKs for programmatic interaction with the Liquid Staking platform.
7. Documentation: Comprehensive documentation for users and developers.
8. Testing and Auditing: Rigorous testing and third-party auditing of the platform for security vulnerabilities.

## Evaluation Criteria
1. Technical expertise in blockchain development, particularly on Substrate.
2. Previous experience in developing staking or DeFi solutions.
3. Budget and timeline feasibility.
4. Quality and innovation of the proposed solution.
