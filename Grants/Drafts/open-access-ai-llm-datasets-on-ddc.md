# Open Access AI & LLM Datasets on the DDC - Grant up to $50,000
Cere invites proposals to develop a system that allows for the storage of AI LLM datasets and models on DDC, ensuring data availability in perpetuity.

## Introduction
The rapid advancement of AI and machine learning models (LLM) has led to an increasing need for reliable, secure, and long-lasting data storage solutions. Traditional cloud storage services, while effective, are centralized and subject to various risks including data loss, unavailability, and potential censorship. Decentralized Data Cloud (DDC) offers a robust, secure, and permanent solution for data storage.

## Background
The Decentralized Data Cloud (DDC) is a decentralized storage network designed to store data in a secure, verifiable, and permanent manner. It offers advantages such as data immutability, redundancy, and the ability to resist censorship. Given the critical nature of AI LLM datasets and models, which are the backbone of various AI applications, storing them on DDC would ensure their long-term availability and integrity.

## Objectives
1. To develop a secure and efficient method for storing AI LLM datasets and models on DDC.
2. To ensure that the stored data is easily retrievable and usable for future research and applications.
3. To create a system that is scalable and can handle large volumes of data.

## Reward
A Builder Grant up to $50,000 is available for this project.

## Scope of Work
### Features to be Supported
1. Data Encryption and Security
    - Implement end-to-end encryption for data before it is stored on DDC.
2. Data Upload and Retrieval
    - Develop methods for uploading datasets and models to DDC.
    - Implement efficient data retrieval mechanisms.
3. Data Versioning
    - Enable version control for datasets and models to track changes over time.
4. User Interface
    - Develop a user-friendly interface for uploading and managing datasets and models.
5. APIs and SDKs
