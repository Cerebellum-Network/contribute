# Add CerePlay Unity/Unreal Engine Support - Grants up to $10,000+
Grant CFP: Develop new CerePlay SDKs to support Unity/Unreal Engine.

## Grant Objective
Cere invites proposals from qualified external developers to convert our existing CerePlay Game SDK into Unity and Unreal Engine SDKs. This initiative aims to extend the SDK's support from HTML5 games to a broader range of Web2/Web3 games developed using Unity and Unreal engines.

## Background
The gaming industry is increasingly adopting Web3 technologies, and game developers are leveraging Unity and Unreal engines for this transition. These engines offer robust ecosystems and a plethora of plugins for blockchain, smart contracts, and NFTs, making them ideal for Web3 game development.

## Deliverables
### **Unreal Engine SDK Conversion**

The project involves converting the existing JavaScript-based Cere Games SDK into an Unreal Engine plugin. The detailed process is outlined **[here](https://github.com/cere-io/cere-games-sdk/tree/master/packages/sdk)**.

### **Unity Engine SDK Conversion**

The Unity SDK conversion will involve creating a Unity plugin that wraps around the functionality of the Cere Games SDK. The detailed process is outlined **[here](https://github.com/cere-io/cere-games-sdk/tree/master/packages/sdk)**.

## **Qualifications**

- Proficiency in HTML5, Unity, and Unreal Engine
- Experience in SDK development
- Familiarity with CERE infrastructure is a plus

## **Proposal Guidelines**

Interested developers should provide:

1. An overview of their experience in Unity, Unreal Engine, and HTML5.
2. Case studies or examples of similar projects undertaken.
3. An estimated timeline for project completion.
4. A pricing model: either an hourly rate or a fixed project fee.

## Reward
Your project could receive up to $10,000 grant along with additional free cloud storage.

## Evaluation Criteria
1. Technical expertise in blockchain development, particularly on Substrate.
2. Previous experience in developing staking or DeFi solutions.
3. Budget and timeline feasibility.
4. Quality and innovation of the proposed solution.

## Submission Guidelines
Only one submission will be approved per person/team/project/request.
The project proposal with the most promise will be selected for completion.
