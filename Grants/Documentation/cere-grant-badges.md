## About Cere Grant Badges

**Once a project's first milestone has been accepted**, we intend to help teams acknowledge their grant publicly while observing the foundation’s guidelines. To that end, we’ve created a badge for grant recipients, available for download in the [*Badges*](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/Cere-Grants-Program/tree/master/Assets/imgs/Badges) folder.

*Before you begin using the badge, please note the following points:*

- Use of the Grants Program badge is reserved for Level 1 and Level 2 grants only. 
*Maintenance Grant Badge COMING SOON.*
- Grants are awarded and should be applied to **specific projects and their related repositories, documentation, etc.** Badges should not be applied to teams in general as a blanket endorsement. **The badge should only be displayed in project-specific contexts.**
- Cere Foundation and its grants program participants **don’t broker partnerships or joint ventures**, or co-sign wholesale any external team’s work.

## How to use the Badge

You are encouraged to display the badge

- in a GitHub repository that contains code connected with the grant project,
- on any project-specific webpage **that specifically concerns the deliverables completed as part of the grant**, or
- when appropriate, in a tweet or blog post announcing your grant in a project-specific context.

You are discouraged to display the badge:

- on your team or project's landing page
- before your first milestone has been accepted,
- on any social media profiles, or
- use it in any other context that could misrepresent your relationship with the Cere  Foundation.

Using the **name or logo of the Web3 Foundation** in any context that could misrepresent your relationship with Cere Foundation can result in an immediate annulment of the grant!

In case of any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us at `community@cere.io`.
