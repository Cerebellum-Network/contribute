# Grant Tracks

The Cere Grants Program targets technology-oriented projects of protocol layer and applications that serve a wide range of users. The program provides guidelines for various areas such as runtime modules/chains, development tools, UI development, backend development, cryptography, research, and documentation. 

Cere is currently accepting Grant Proposals that cover all all areas of the Cere Stack, including innovations in Web2 Application integrations, bleeding edge, on-chain Dapps and Smart Contract systems, development and testing tools, optimizations, and other ideas that are important for the Cere Network and the Decentralized Data Cloud ecosystem.

We're thrilled that you're interested in applying for a grant with Cere. We are looking forward to your reviewing your application!

## Runtime Modules/Chains

### Applies to

- Building/extending Cere Network (Substrate) pallets

### Requirements

- List the publicly exposed methods
- For each method, specify (to the best of present knowledge):
    - Method signature (incl. parameters with their types, return type)
    - Short description (code template)
- Runtime Storage defined by your module
- [Use case diagram](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Use_case_diagram) with e.g. UML or SysML (or similar tool demonstrating how external users/system components interact with one another)

## Development Tools

### Applies to

- API and SDKs
- CLI tools
- IDE / IDE plugin

### Requirements

- State what programming language you'll use
- Describe the commands that you want to make available to the users:
    - Name
    - Parameters
    - Result (value returned / file created or modified / application started etc.)

## UI Development

### Applies to

- Building a web application with front-end components
- Developing a mobile app

### Requirements

- Provide mockups and/or wireframes (e.g. Figma)
- List frameworks & tools for development & testing (e.g. React Native, Angular)

## Backend Development

### Applies to

- Building a service/mobile app/webapp that relies on a back-end component

### Requirements

- State what language & framework you'll use (e.g. python with Django, Rust with Rocket)
- Define your database requirements and which system you'll use
- Choose how & where will your backend be hosted (cloud provider, IPFS, localhost?)
- Consider scaling & how you plan to handle it
- Consider CI/CD
- If you are (planning on) hosting the backend yourself, consider adding a [security.txt](https://securitytxt.org/) file so people can get in touch with you regarding (potential) security issues
- Provide a link to your Github repository if you already have the structure in place

## Cryptography

### Applies to

- New crypto library
- Extending existing library's functionalities

### Requirements

- Specify what programming language you'll use
- Provide any publications/papers you will base your work on
- Research other crypto libraries providing similar functionalities. State whether/how you plan to use their work. If they don't suit your needs, provide a detailed explanation why and what's missing
- List any existing crypto libraries that you will use as reference implementation (e.g. in a different language)

## Research

### Applies to

- Research projects related to decentralized storage and content delivery optimizations
- New Utility and Product Use-cases

### Requirements

- Specify the problem(s) that you want to investigate, and why these are important.
- Declare the research questions/hypothesis.
- State the methodology that will be applied.
- Explain how the data will be collected and the analysis procedures.
- Outline the expected results and how they would be double-checked by the grants team (reproducibility of the data analysis).
- Research for relevant related work or declare how the literature review will be conducted.
- Research and declare the intended venue for results publication and the timeline for publication.

## Documentation

- Improve existing documentation generation pipelines
- Publish new educational programs and content
