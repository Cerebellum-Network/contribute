### Project Details
> L0 Grants - Maintenance Grant
> Specify the following additional details: 
> - The repo(s) that need maintenance
> - Why the project should continue being supported
> - A broad overview of the features/bugs that need development contributions
> - An assurance that the current project owners are willing to review/accept your contributions
> - Max budget per month
> - Max hours per month
> - Requested duration of activity (how long will can you commitment to the role)

> L1 & L2 Grants
> We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. 
> Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (with urls or DDC file CIDs included) at following :
> - Mockups/designs of any UI components
> - Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
> - An overview of the technology stack to be used
> - Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
> - PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

### Ecosystem Fit
> Help us locate your project in the Cere Network and DDC landscape, the problems solves:
> - Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
> - What need(s) does your project meet?
> - Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Cere ecosystem?
>     - If so, how is your project different?
>     - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

### Team members

> References any past publications and projects in a related domain are helpful, etc.

## Development Roadmap
> This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. 
> Describe *the functionality expected in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. 
> Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.
> For each milestone,
> - make sure to include a specification of your software. *Treat it as a contract*; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
> - include the amount of funding requested *per milestone*.
> - include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
> - provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
> - commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
> - indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone, and include the approximate number of days along with the cost per day.
> - *Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory* and shall not be removed, unless you explicitly specify a reason within the PR's `Additional Notes` section (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).
> We *suggest* scoping the project to fit in a three-month period, and to structure the roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

## Overview
- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** Required workload of a full-time employee for the whole project (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent)) (e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Amount of payment in USD for the whole project. The total amount of funding *needs to be below $30k* (e.g. 12,000 USD)

### Milestone 1 
> Milestone 1 Example — Implement XXX
> - **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
> - **FTE:** 2
> - **Costs:** 8,000 USD
> Deliverables
> 1. Testing Guide : Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. 
> In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
> 2. Deliverable X: We will create … that will... (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the first milestone)
> 3. Deliverable Y: We will create … that will … 
> 4. Deliverable Z: We will create … that will …

💡 These Milestones are what you will be invoicing for payment later.

## Future Plans
> Please include here
> - how you intend to use, enhance, promote and support your project in the short term, and
> - the team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it.

## Additional Information
> Any additional information that you think is relevant to this application that hasn't already been included.
> - Are there are any teams who have already contributed (financially) to your project?
> - Do you have a community of users or open-source developers who are contributing to your project?
