# Deploy On-Chain Analytics Dashboard

## Status
Looking for Help

## Objective
This Bounty is tailored for those passionate about data and on-chain analytics to help the Cere community explore, analyze, and derive insights from on-chain datasets using flipsidecrypto.xyz and dune.com.

## Reward
A $250 bounty is up for grabs!

## Abstract
Cere invites you to create and share new on-chain analytics dashboards and reports using flipsidecrypto.xyz or dune.com with the growing Cere Contributor community.

## Background
At Cere, having access to reporting on key on-chain data is crucial for successful operation of the network. At this time, Cere Network community does not have any publicly available community managed Dashboards for tracking insights into the Cere Network on-chain activities across networks. 

We would like to challenge you to help us change that, for the following reasons:

1. **Transparency**: Improve human readability of blockchain activities through improved dashboard UX.
2. **Decision Making**: Investors and developers can make informed choices about how to engage with the Cere Network by understanding transaction patterns and project metrics.
3. **Security**: Analyzing on-chain data helps Cere contributor’s detect potential threats or malicious activities to the network as a whole or their apps seperately.
4. **Community Engagement**: The community should be able to share, discuss, collaborate, and report on important insights found on-chain.

### CERE Token ERC20 on Ethereum and Polygon Networks

$CERE tokens are on Ethereum and Polygon, bridged over from the native token on Cere Mainnet:

1. $CERE Ethereum
    
    https://etherscan.io/token/0x2dA719DB753dFA10a62E140f436E1d67F2ddB0d6
    
2. $CERE Polygon
    
    https://polygonscan.com/token/0x2dA719DB753dFA10a62E140f436E1d67F2ddB0d6
    

💡Check out [this article](https://www.notion.so/c7f0bd881489400588d713e7897aeb33?pvs=21) for more information about how to bridge your $CERE ERC20 tokens to Polygon from the Cere Mainnet.

### Cere On-chain Data

The Decentralized Data Cloud (DDC) revolutionizes how data is stored and accessed, ensuring security and efficiency. Using [smart contracts](https://www.notion.so/4691938012214f20a2704e6923e1dfc4?pvs=21) powered by CERE token and innovations such as [Decentralized Data Clusters](https://www.notion.so/f73b0d009ed34392a373ab77baef0d07?pvs=21) and the [Data Activity Capture system](https://www.notion.so/85600315200840bc8ce7da4938c36b24?pvs=21), and the amount and relevance of on-chain activities related to the DDC is steadily increasing. 

Areas of on-chain activities that are already generating on-chain data to be explored:

CERE token is the native token of Cere Blockchain Mainnet, first made [available for staking in March 2022](https://cere-network.medium.com/announcing-cere-network-early-mainnet-staking-a4149961d051). It gives community voting rights and is the native token for [smart contracts](https://www.notion.so/6872011fd18d409ba6f08bc18cb57ff8?pvs=21) on the [Cere Blockchain](https://www.notion.so/Blockchain-611cb8bb2bca45009b4f03570b1d0dc8?pvs=21) too.

*CerePlay* is an early-stage project to provide developers with the tools and resources needed to quickly integrate Web3 features like Cere Decentralized Leaderboard, on-chain NFT rewards, and on-chain payments for gameplay and digital assets and experiences directly into their games with minimal coding required.
