# Secure Note Sharing Application Demo on DDC
Demonstrate the power and security of Cere DDC cloud storage platform by launching a Note sharing application with [Cere DDC-SDK-JS](https://github.com/CereNetwork/ddc-sdk-js) and earn $250 per milestone completed!

## Background
Developers and the general public often need to share code, notes and other text-only snippets. There are many applications on the web that enable this, including [Github Gists](https://gist.github.com), [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) and [Privnote](https://privnote.com/). At their core, each are simple, yet powerful and widely used services for sending notes to anyone on the web. 

For inspiration or a base from which to start building your note sharing application, we believe these repo's and tutorial resources might be helpful: 

- Pastebin: [@JoeBiellik/paste](https://github.com/JoeBiellik/paste), [@mstallmo/paste.rs](https://github.com/mstallmo/paste.rs)
- Privnote: [How to Build a Privnote Clone](https://remarkablemark.org/blog/2022/04/23/how-to-build-a-privnote-clone/), [@remarkablemark/Replit-Privnote](https://github.com/remarkablemark/Replit-Privnote)

By integrating your note sharing application with Cere's **[DDC-SDK-JS](https://github.com/CereNetwork/ddc-sdk-js)**, we aim to bring the benefits of decentralized cloud storage to this secure note-sharing platform. The Cere DDC SDK is a software development kit for interacting with Cere's Decentralized Data Cloud that empowers developers to build secure applications powered by the Decentralized Data Cloud. Some of the features you might use to complete this project are:

- [Content Addressable Storage](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/cere-ddc-sdk-js/blob/main/packages/content-addressable-storage/README.md)
- [Key Value Storage](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/cere-ddc-sdk-js/blob/main/packages/key-value-storage/README.md)
- [Data Encryption](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/cere-ddc-sdk-js/blob/main/packages/core/README.md#cipher)
- [DDC Client](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/cere-ddc-sdk-js/blob/main/packages/ddc-client/README.md)


## Deliverables
### Milestone 1 - Public Notes
* Estimated duration: 1 day

1. Locally deployable Note sharing application.
 - New Bucket is created and funded with [Cere Testnet](https://stats.cere.network/faucet) tokens.
2. End-User should be able to complete the following tasks using a simple Javascript based web-ui:
 - Create and save a new PUBLIC (unencrypted) "note"++ to the application specific bucket.
 - Load and view the previously created PUBLIC "note".
 - Delete existing PUBLIC "note" (or otherwise make the "note" inaccessible).
3. Basic error handling (404: not found).
4. A clear README with deployment and feature descriptions.

++ Notes should have a maximum upload size of 1MB.

### Milestone 2 - Private + Secure Notes
* Estimated duration: 1 day

5. End-User should be able to complete the following tasks:
- Create and save a new PRIVATE (unencrypted) "note" that can only be opened ONE-TIME or 2) expires after set time-limit.
- Load and be able to view an un-expired PRIVATE "note" ONE-TIME.
- Create and save a new SECURE (encrypted) "note", which only a specified wallet address owner can read.
- Load and view the existing SECURE "note" from specified wallet address. 
7. Additional error handling (401: not authorized).

### Not in Scope
* It is not necessary for the application to have any additional features or design elements other than those necessary to complete the required deliverables.

## Resources
* To learn more about how to build applications with the latest version of Cere DDC JS, see the [Cere Developer Quickstart Guidebook](https://docs.cere.network/ddc/developer-guide/quickstart).
