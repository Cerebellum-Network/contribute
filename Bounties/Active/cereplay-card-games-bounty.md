## Background
Build or otherwise modify the best open source JS based [card game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck) (❌🃏) in 6 weeks, integrating with the full spectrum of features provided by the new CerePlay [Game JS SDK](https://www.notion.so/69865967cd63430892a54167df9b7bdf?pvs=21), and you can win up to $500! 

Developers can mod simple games with Cere tools for prizes and token. 
A library you might consider, https://github.com/einaregilsson/cards.js, has produced the following games:
- [Spades](https://cardgames.io/spades/)
- [Hearts](https://cardgames.io/hearts/)
- [Whist](https://cardgames.io/whist/)
- [Go Fish](https://cardgames.io/gofish/)

- [Solitaire](https://cardgames.io/solitaire/)
- [FreeCell](https://cardgames.io/freecell/)
- [Idiot](https://cardgames.io/idiot/)

Basically, it's possible you'd extend [cards.js](https://github.com/einaregilsson/cards.js) with [Cere Gaming SDK](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/cere-ddc-sdk-js) and deploy on [CerePlay](https://www.notion.so/478ce52cd1414870b9b6792a1b1909ca?pvs=21).
