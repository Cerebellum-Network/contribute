# Secure Note Sharing Application Demo on DDC
Demonstrate the power and security of Cere DDC cloud storage platform by launching a Note sharing application with [Cere DDC-SDK-JS](https://github.com/CereNetwork/ddc-sdk-js) and earn $250 per milestone completed!

## Background
Developers and the general public often need to share code, notes and other text-only snippets. There are many applications on the web that enable this, including [Github Gists](https://gist.github.com), [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) and Privnote [privnote.com](https://privnote.com/). At their core, each are unbelievely simple, yet powerful and widely used services for sending notes to anyone on the web. 

In fact, if you're looking for inspiration or a base from which to start building your note sharing application, check these repo's (DYOR):
- Pastbin Clones: [@JoeBiellik/paste](https://github.com/JoeBiellik/paste), [@mstallmo/paste.rs](https://github.com/mstallmo/paste.rs)
- Privnote Clones: [@remarkablemark/how-to-build-a-privnote-clone/](https://remarkablemark.org/blog/2022/04/23/how-to-build-a-privnote-clone/), [@remarkablemark/Replit-Privnote](https://github.com/remarkablemark/Replit-Privnote)

By integrating your note sharing application with Cere's **[DDC-SDK-JS](https://github.com/CereNetwork/ddc-sdk-js)**, we aim to bring the benefits of decentralized storage to this secure note-sharing platform.

The Cere DDC SDK is a software development kit for interacting with Cere's Decentralized Data Cloud that empowers developers to build secure applications powered by the Decentralized Data Cloud. Some of the features we might expect you to use for this project are:
- [Content Addressable Storage](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/cere-ddc-sdk-js/blob/main/packages/content-addressable-storage/README.md)
- [Key Value Storage](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/cere-ddc-sdk-js/blob/main/packages/key-value-storage/README.md)
- [Data Encryption](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/cere-ddc-sdk-js/blob/main/packages/core/README.md#cipher)
- [DDC Client](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network/cere-ddc-sdk-js/blob/main/packages/ddc-client/README.md)


## Deliverables
### Milestone 1 - Public Notes
1. Locally deployable Note sharing application.
 - New Bucket is created and funded with [Cere Testnet](https://stats.cere.network/faucet) tokens.
2. End-User should be able to complete the following tasks using a simple Javascript based web-ui:
 - Create and save a new PUBLIC "note"++ to the application specific bucket.
 - Load and view the previously created PUBLIC "note".
 - Delete existing PUBLIC "note".
3. Basic error handling (404: not found).
4. A clear README with deployment and feature descriptions.

### Milestone 2 - Private Notes
5. End-User should be able to complete the following tasks:
- Create and save a new PRIVATE "note" that 1) "self-destructs" upon opening 2) expires after set time-limit.
- Load and be able to view an un-opened, non-expired PRIVATE "note" ONE-TIME.

### Milestone 3 - Secure Notes
7. End-User should be able to complete the following tasks: 
- Create & pay for a new SECURE (encrypted) "note", which only a specified wallet address owner can read.
- Connect Polkadot{.js} wallet to the application.
- Load and view the existing SECURE "note" from specified wallet address. 
8. Additional error handling (401: not authorized).

++ Notes should have a maximum upload size of 1MB.
