The Cere Network is built from multiple core Web3 protocols and is capable of powering a future of interoperable, privacy-preserving, and serverless data. Features include:****

- Persistent, searchable, sharable data on [DDC](https://www.notion.so/DDC-4bd55be437b642158bb3ab28961d8ee6?pvs=21).
- Decentralized Content Delivery Network ([dCDN](https://www.notion.so/dCDN-8a29b6882e754c6caa952a1ca844dc27?pvs=21)) to access and power data apps.
